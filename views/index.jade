      h3 Welcome to #{classname} #{semester} #{year}.
      h4 This semester we'll be using Gitlab for team collaboration and project submission. 
      p With this tool, you can create or join a team and we'll be able to automatically create repositories for your group!
      p After you've made a team you can share the unique key we give you with the other members of your group so they can join.
